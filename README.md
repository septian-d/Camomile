# Qiskit Global Summer School
Qiskit organizes global camps almost each year. The Summer school this year was hosted online due to COVID situation (and it was free). I came to know about Qiskit Global Summer School when I was super-bored in my home and nothing much really to do than reading paper and preparing my learning video for teaching next semester.
